<h3>Simple online store using Angular.js.</h3>
It was my final project from Logos IT Academy courses.<br><br>
There is an ability to add, upgrade and remove categories and products. <br>Data is saved in local storage.<br>
Products can be filtered by categories, added to the shopping cart or favorite.<br> 
No backend, without usage of db.
